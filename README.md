This tool help you print outer wall with height = 1/2 inner wall, infill, support. Mean you print with "0.2mm height" time and get smooth like "0.1mm height".
At the moment, Cura have option to set infill height, support height. So if you only print with 2 wall (1 outer, 1 inner wall) this tool not help very much.
Better if you print 3 wall or more (1 outer, 2 inner wall or more).
Not work very well, hope Cura or Prusa make this feature.
